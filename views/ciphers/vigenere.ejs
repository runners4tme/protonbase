          This is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that that use characters of a sentence or word as keys.
          The characters are split into a multiple subkeys.
          The more letters are provided as keys, the stronger it will be the encrypted message.
          The key can be a combo of words and numbers just more make it more harder.
          A key of a sentence with 3 words is normally sufficient for a normal distribution.

        <p class="descriptionBody col s8 offset-s2">
          Here is the implementation of the encryption process:
        </p>
        <ol class="algorithm col s8 offset-s2">
          <li>Loop through each letter of the plaintext.</li>
          <li>Get the number of the letter in the alphabet order.</li>
          <li>Add number of the subkey that corresponds to that letter.</li>
          <li>If the result is ever above the range of 0 and 25</li>
          <li>Subtract 26 to bring the number to our desired range.</li>
          <li>Move to the next subkey of the encryption key.</li>
          <li>If the character is not a letter, add it to the ciphertext.</li>
          <li>Return the plaintext and ciphertext.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="descriptionBody col s8 offset-s2">
          Mathematically the encryption can be denoted as C = (p, k) where j = 0.
        </p>
        <p class="descriptionBody col s8 offset-s2">
          The number of possible keys multiplies by 26 for every additional letter that is part of the key.
          It would take a computer years to break quadrillions of possible keys.
          It was called the indecipherable cipher for a good reason.

          Do not use a word in the dictionary because it will obviously make your code prone to a dictionary attack.
          This mean that the hacker will attempt to unlock it with every word as key key in the dictionery.

          Mathematically the decryption is p = x, c = (x,k) where j = i mod 6.

        <p class="descriptionBody col s8 offset-s2">
          To hack this cipher, we need to find the words with high frequency.
          This cipher was regarded as unbreakable until Charles Baggage broke it but never published his papaer.
          We have to identify the patterns of three or more characters. Write down the begining position of each pattern.
          Then compute the differences between the starting point and the ending point. And lastly determine all the factors for the differences.
          The key is one of the frequent common factors.
