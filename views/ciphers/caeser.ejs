          A ceaser cipher is a monoalphabetic substitution cipher that was named after Julius Ceaser.
          It works by adding a key repeatedly to the of the letters in the plaintext where A = 0 and Z = 25 and the addition is done module 26.
          We loop through each letter in the plaintext and check if that letter is part of the alphabet order. If it is not part of it,
          we just add it to the ciphertext text as it is, if it is, we add the key to the position of that letter and
          if the result is ever above the range of 0 and 25, we simply subtract a multiple of 26 to bring is to our desired range.
          Mathematically we denote the ciphertext as C = P + K mod 26.
          To decrypt is also simple, all we have to do is to subtract the key from the position of the letter
          and if the result is below zero we simple add a multiple of 26 to make sure that it is within the desired range.

           The problem with this cipher is that is is easy to break because you only have to loop throughout 26 keys
           and the key that will return the plaintext that is readable is the encryption key that was used for the ciphertext.
           This process is called the brute-force attack.It would have taken ages to try out each key during those days
           but thanks to computers, We can hack it in a matter of milliseconds.
