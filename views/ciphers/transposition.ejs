          A transposition cipher is a all about confusion. It is an encryption where the letters are rearranged.
          It is about using a key to jumble the letters of the plaintext so that it becomes unreadable.
          We are going to look at the a simple columner transposition where the letters of the plaintext are
          divided into columns using the encryption key. This cipher is easy to grasp, we devide the plaintext into rows,
          the rows are the length of the key. Then we loop through the columns which are horizontal until we get to the end
          of all the characters of the plaintext. this cipher is not really appropreate for long messages.
          Because it is quadratic and takes a lot of memory and time.

      <div class="row">

          To decrypt the transposition cipher we need to first figure out the number of the rows that the rows formed,
          this is the key used, we also need to figure out the number of columns which is the length of the message
          over the key. This will allow us to draw a grid of boxes where we can just fill in the letters and we
          also have to calculate the empty spaces because not all the columns will have the same length.
        </p>
        <p class="descBody col s8 offset-s2">
          To hack the transposition cipher is a bit complex, we are still going to use to brute-force attack.
          We are going to try out every single key that we can and the one that will result is english that we can read is the
          encryption key. We also need to loop through each word of the plaintext so detect is if is english or not.
          We have created a separate program for this. It simply loops each word and see if it can find it in an english dictionary
          and if it can find it, the more words it can find the likely hood of the encryption key being correct.
