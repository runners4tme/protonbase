  <h3>Cryptography</h3>


  <div class="row">
      <p class="descriptionBody col s8 offset-s2">
        <b>Cryptography</b> is the fusion of security engineering and mathematics.
        It refers to the science and art of designing ciphers.
        A cryptographer is a person who uses and design ciphers.
        Cryptanalysis is the science and art of breaking these ciphers and
        A cryptanalyst is a person who can hack secret codes and read other people’s encrypted messages.
        A cryptanalyst can do hack an encrypted message by identifying patterns in the message, in order
        to be produce a decryption algorithm or simply find general weakness in an encryption algorithm,
        without necessarily having intercepted the message.
        Cryptanalysts are also called <b>hackers</b>.

              The harpoon was darted; the stricken whale Yew forward; with igniting velocity the line ran through the grooves;—ran foul.
              Ahab stooped to clear it; he did clear it; but the Yying turn caught himround the neck,
              and voicelessly as Turkish mutes bowstring their victim, he was shot out of the boat, ere the crew knew he was gone.

         The message that is in plain English is called <b>plaintext</b> and the encrypted message is called a <b>ciphertext</b>.
         The plaintext above on right hand side has been encrypted with a transposition cipher.
         The ciphertext is impossible to read the message unless you know know how the decrypt it.
         It is just random letters with no meaning whatsoever.
         Encrypting your written messages is one way to keep them secret from other people, even if they
         get their hands on the encrypted message itself. They won't be able to understand it.
      </p>
      <p class="descriptionBody col s8 offset-s2">
        A <b>cipher</b> is a set of rules for converting between plaintext and ciphertext.
        These rules often use a secret key. This key is called an encryption key.
        The encryption key is the secret to encrypting or decrypting the message.
        Block ciphers may either have one key for both encryption and decryption, in which
        case they’re called shared key, or have separate keys for encryption and
        decryption, in which case they’re called public key or asymmetric.
        Please not that encrypting more a message than once does not provide additional strength to the cipher for most of these ciphers.
        We are going to explore 5 ciphers that were used ages ago and easy to hack with modern computers.
